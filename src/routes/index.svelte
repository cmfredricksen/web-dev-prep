<h2>
    Welcome to Web Dev Prep
</h2>

<section>
    <p>There is a lot more to learning web development than choosing a language and/or framework. You need to also learn how to use your computer, OS, version control and more. These other skills will make you a better developer, and make development more enjoyable.</p>
    
    <p>These topics are things to practice when you need a break from the language you are learning. Many of them you can also begin to implement even in your earlier work. You don't have to be a developer to get a lot of use out of these skills. Enjoy!</p>
