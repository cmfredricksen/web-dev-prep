## Preparing for the Project

To get started you should have a few things ready to go:

1. **Have a SvelteKit project set up.** <a href="./Svelte-Kit-Setup.md">How to set up a SvelteKit project</a>
2. **In your static folder add 3 images to use while we get this working**. I get free images from Pexels.
3. **In your lib/components folder make a slide-show.svelte file.** This will be your component which you can then import into any file.
4. **Make a file(route) to import your component into** while working on this project so we can display it in the server. I named mine slide-show.md. I used markdown, but you can use a svelte file also.

<style>
    li {
        margin: 1rem; 0
    }
</style>
